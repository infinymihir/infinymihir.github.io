Mihir led the GIS and data analysis as part of the Transit Master Plan update. Mihir was tasked with managing the GIS database and supporting the planning and outreach team with data analysis, graphic and map creation. Mihir also led the transit efficiency analysis, focusing on key performance indicators for Light Rail, Local Bus Routes, Express Bus Routes, Circulators, Paratransit, and RideChoice service. Mihir worked with Remix software to schedule new routes and estimate the cost of operations. The project recently won the ['Best Analytical Mapâ€™](https://agic-symposium-maps-and-apps-agic.hub.arcgis.com/documents/6c8e1c5faba74eeb91c25eaeb0975ef6) award in the Maps and Apps contest at the Arizona Geographic Information Council 2024 Training Symposium.

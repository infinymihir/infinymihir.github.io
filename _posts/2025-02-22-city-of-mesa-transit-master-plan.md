The City of Mesa Transit Master Plan is a 25-year plan designed to meet the needs of the city for both the short and long term. The plan helps ensure that the transit network responds to growth and change, provides connection to significant activity centers, and maintains a strong link to the regional network. The future transit network is a result of public engagement and technical analysis using various current and future data. The outcome of this exercise stems from processing various data. Automated analysis of data sources aided in increasing efficiency of the process and reduced analysis time by up to 75%. The map displays the proposed short-term, mid-term and long-term routes along with microtransit zones. Maps of the data used for analysis have also been shown.

Mihir led the GIS and data analysis as part of the Transit Master Plan update. Mihir was tasked with managing the GIS database and supporting the planning and outreach team with data analysis, graphic and map creation. Mihir also led the transit efficiency analysis, focusing on key performance indicators for Light Rail, Local Bus Routes, Express Bus Routes, Circulators, Paratransit, and RideChoice service. Mihir worked with Remix software to schedule new routes and estimate the cost of operations. The project recently won the ** ['Best Analytical Mapâ€™](https://agic-symposium-maps-and-apps-agic.hub.arcgis.com/documents/6c8e1c5faba74eeb91c25eaeb0975ef6) ** award in the Maps and Apps contest at the Arizona Geographic Information Council 2024 Training Symposium.

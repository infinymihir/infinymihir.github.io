AECOM is developing a 20-year Master Plan for the Grand Rapids area aimed to identify intercounty corridors. Mihir assisted in the analysis and mapping of trip pattern data from Replica, the identification and evaluation of transit corridors using current and future conditions, and the prioritization of corridors based on demand, growth, and equity indicators. Mihir also implemented an automated Python script to analyze various data along the routes, reducing the time spent and increasing the efficiency of the task.

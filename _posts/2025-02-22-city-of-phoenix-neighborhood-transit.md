### [Check out the Interactive StoryMap here] (https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/f6dc85e6e2294a0fb84dde9be8e983eb/)

Mihir assisted with the maps and graphics for existing State of Practice research, existing conditions analysis, and community outreach. Mihir designed custom ArcGIS StoryMaps using Experience Builder and HTML coding to ensure effective community education and outreach. Mihir also assisted with Federal Grants related to the implementation of this project. The StoryMap won the [‘Best Application’](https://agic-symposium-maps-and-apps-agic.hub.arcgis.com/apps/5d9dc009ec8e48a5a7187add4e3f4232) award in the Maps and Apps contest at the Arizona Geographic Information Council 2024 Training Symposium.
